/**
 * A message asking this thread to end itself, rather than be terminated.
 *
 * `Worker.terminate()` tears a thread down from the outside, and doing that to
 * a thread that has loaded the tree-sitter native bindings SEGFAULTS the whole
 * process -- the parses need not even be in flight, an idle worker that has
 * parsed once is enough. Measured on Windows/Node 26 at ~8% per teardown, and
 * the pool terminates every worker at the end of every run, so roughly one
 * `ix map` in twelve exited 139 after a completely successful ingest: patches
 * committed, summary printed, non-zero status for anything reading `$?`.
 *
 * Closing the port from INSIDE lets the thread unwind its own event loop and
 * dispose its isolate in order. Measured 0 crashes in the same experiment.
 *
 * The teardown contract, precisely, because the pool's half of it changed and
 * this is the only place the worker states it: `ParsePool` never terminates a
 * worker. If one does not answer, the pool stops waiting and `unref()`s it, so
 * the CLI can exit while the thread is still alive. Nothing reclaims a wedged
 * thread before the process ends -- do not write code here that relies on
 * being killed, and do not "restore" a `terminate()` fallback in the pool,
 * which is the segfault itself.
 *
 * Not exported: `ix-cli` does not depend on this package and inlines the
 * literal, and this module throws at load outside a worker thread, so an
 * importer could not use the type anyway. The binding between the two is the
 * test that runs `ParsePool` against this built file.
